  <h3> Release Info </h3>
  
  This is the second public release of the ODI exposure <br/>
  time calculator; it has only been tested yet with a <br/>
  small user basis. However, the throughput model has <br/>
  been adjusted to match the photometric<br/>
 zeropoints that have been measured in February 2014 after <br/>
  thorough mirror cleaning. <br/>
  <br/>
  Use at your own risk!
